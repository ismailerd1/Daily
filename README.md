Daily is a news site that stands out with its simple design, where daily news is shared or (in later stages) news from selected sources is shown, and its areas of concentration are finance and technology.

Users can easily read the news and see the source and author without logging in. There is also a news creation page for news that users want to be shared. After admin approval, the news created to be added to 
the page waits in the admin panel.
I am thinking of adding news directly to this site on selected news sites with web-scraping in the future.

      python -m venv venv
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

    Use `pip` to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Superuser**:

    superuser for usage:
    	username: gitguest
    	e-mail: fromgithub@gmail.com
    	password: dailynews11


5. **Start the development server**:

    Finally, start your Django development server using the following command:

    ```bash
